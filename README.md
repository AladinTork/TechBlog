# TechBlog 

  ## Description
  
  Writing about technology is just as important as building it. Developers often create applications and debug existing codebases, but they also engage with the community by writing about technical concepts, advancements, and emerging technologies.
  
  This project is a CMS-style blog site designed for developers to publish their blog posts and engage with others through comments. Built from scratch and deployed on Render, this application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm, utilizing Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize as the ORM, and express-session for authentication.

  The deployed application can be found at: https://techblog-bogk.onrender.com/
